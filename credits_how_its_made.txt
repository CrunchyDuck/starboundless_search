This is a longer list of credits that will detail EVERYTHING that I (remembered I) used.
My hope is that this will help people build their own programs in the future without all the needless research I did.


Programming language: Python 3.8

=== Packages used in Python ===

= User interface =
Tkinter: User interface
PIL (ImageTk, Image): Used to make Tkinter easier to work with. Tkinter is old and has bad traditions.

= Database =
Sqlite3: Database management
RegEx (re): Used to more effectively search patterns. Regex is fucking amazing, learn it if you work with pattern recognition ever.

= File tools =
pathlib: Searching folders on the PC, getting information about files/directories, etc.
subprocess: Used to run the asset_unpacker.exe required to unpack files.
os: A lot of basic functions relating to working with an operating system.
shutil: Deleting trees. It has other applications that I didn't end up using, which is why I'm using it.
hashlib: Creates a signature of a file, so I can see if any data has changed in it.
json: Makes reading JSON files very easy.

= Debugging and performance =
datetime: Takes the current date and time, among other things. I use it for performance benchmarking.
traceback: Allows you to print what your program was using at any point in time. Useful for debugging.
logging: Used to log information about the program running. Vital for debugging.
