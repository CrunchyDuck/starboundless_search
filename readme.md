# Starboundless Search
Starboundless Search (SLS) is a tool that allows you to search any data about recipes and items (referred to as "things") dynamically in your copy of Starbound. SLS can adapt to include mods that you download, update, or remove from your game.
The goal of SLS is to solve the difficulty of managing the many crafting places and poor search functionality provided by default by allowing the user to search anything, from what the recipe requires, to the bench it's crafted at, or to search the description of an object to find out which object it is.

SLS right now is a console-based application that is able to search all recipes stored in the base game, and the mod Frackin Universe. It'll output this searched data to a file containing all matching and relevant information.

## Using and downloading
A video explaining what this tool is, how to download it and how to use it can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Xt_YYlCPHo6Wp6eafARog)  
The latest version of SLS can be found [here.](https://github.com/CrunchyDuck/starboundless_search/releases)  

## Planned Features
I'll list the most important ones here, but a more comprehensive list can be found at my [Discord server.](https://discord.gg/TzTn4cy)
* Add User Interface! (Very important, and what is required for all following goals)
* Allow the user to unpack and update their database based on their mods. The code is in place, but not the user control.
* More file parsing! Each file needs a special preset made for it to properly parse the data. The more time I can spend on this, the more presets, and the more accurate data indexed.
* More recipe indexing! Indexing Input/Output benches like the handmill from Frackin Universe will allow me to list more recipes.
* "Object" Codex! A full description of an object and where to get it, including monster drops, recipes, loot tables, and world generation.

## Reporting Bugs And Suggesting Cools:
The best way to report any oddities you find are to join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/TzTn4cy), provide the log file, and discuss what happened.
Supporting is much the same, except without a log file and without being annoyed at me.

## Supporting
If you like my attempt at making cool tools and things like this, I would greatly appreciate any support you can give me, as this has been a huge undertaking of time and energy.
The best way would to just let me know you appreciate this by joining me at my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/TzTn4cy).  
If you really want to make me feel like I owe the world all the work I can give, you could also...
